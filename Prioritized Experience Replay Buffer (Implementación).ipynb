    "     samples important transitions more frequently.\n",
    "    The transitions are prioritized by the Temporal Difference error (td error), $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We sample transition $i$ with probability,\n",
    "    $$P(i) = \\frac{p_i^\\alpha}{\\sum_k p_k^\\alpha}$$\n",
    "    where $\\alpha$ is a hyper-parameter that determines how much\n",
    "    prioritization is used, with $\\alpha = 0$ corresponding to uniform case.\n",

    "\n",
    "    We use proportional prioritization $p_i = |\\delta_i| + \\epsilon$ where\n",
    "    $\\delta_i$ is the temporal difference for transition $i$.\n",

    "    $$w_i = \\bigg(\\frac{1}{N} \\frac{1}{P(i)}\\bigg)^\\beta$$ in the loss function.\n",

    "    it is similar for minimum.\n",
    "    Let $x_i$ be the list of $N$ values we want to represent.\n",
    "    Let $b_{i,j}$ be the $j^{\\mathop{th}}$ node of the $i^{\\mathop{th}}$ row\n",
    "     in the binary tree.\n",
    "    That is two children of node $b_{i,j}$ are $b_{i+1,2j}$ and $b_{i+1,2j + 1}$.\n",

    "    Every node keeps the sum of the two child nodes.\n",
    "    That is, the root node keeps the sum of the entire array of values.\n",
    "    The left and right children of the root node keep\n",
    "     the sum of the first half of the array and\n",
    "     the sum of the second half of the array, respectively.\n",
    "    And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$b_{i,j} = \\sum_{k = (j -1) * 2^{D - i} + 1}^{j * 2^{D - i}} x_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Number of nodes in row $i$,\n",
    "    $$N_i = \\left\\lceil{\\frac{N}{D - i + 1}} \\right\\rceil$$\n",
    "    This is equal to the sum of nodes in all rows above $i$.\n",
    "    So we can use a single array $a$ to store the tree, where,\n",
    "    $$b_{i,j} \\rightarrow a_{N_i + j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then child nodes of $a_i$ are $a_{2i}$ and $a_{2i + 1}$.\n",
